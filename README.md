# BLEach
Clean new approach to BLE wrapper for python

After spending a week starting and then stalling on a python-based scanner for BLE devices (specifically starting from a MAC OS X platform), while also keeping in mind a desire to be platform-independent (targeting Raspian initially), I have decided, as all engineers do, to create another BLE wrapper for python.

This library will aim to support non-ble bluetooth devices down the line but am aiming at simpler BLE devices and BLE sensors using the GATT interface.

Will try to keep moving this forward, I apologize in advance for people that land here hoping to find something that is currently working.

Will be targeting a framework that supports CoreBluetooth on the MAC, with an entirely python based code base (will attempt to build a code base that does not require native code). Will decide on interface support for Raspian later, along with Linux and then Windows support.

Stay tuned, will be a bumpy ride.

# Installation

- once I have the module working I will try to get it uploaded into the PyPI, at first install will be via download and direct importing

# Documentation

- check back here initially, but will eventually provide an online reference guide

# Reference Links
CoreBluetooth (Apple) - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth
PyObjC (CoreBluetooth) - https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/tree/master/pyobjc-framework-CoreBluetooth

# Sample Code

- will provide a basic main program to demonstate how the library works
